# tetrisfish
A stockfish-style nes tetris analysis tool. This will download a given youtube video, extract tetris board state,  and run through an evaulator to find mistakes in board stacking! This software requires a stable internet connection to be able to communicate with StackRabbit. It is run on Python 3 through the graphics library Pygame.

# Special thanks
TetrisFish is powered by StackRabbit, a tetris AI made by Gregory Cannon that this program communicates with. I am grateful Greg was open to this idea and worked with me to create an API endpoint for this software. Refer to this link for more information: https://github.com/GregoryCannon/StackRabbit

This project would not have been possible without...
- HydrantDude: a graphics artist who designed the sexy UI for callibration and analysis (in progress)
- Grzechooo: prolific bugfixing
- Xenophilius: bugtesting, logo design, and graphics consultant
- MegaTech: Tetris expert and tuning for rating categories
and last but not least, countless beta testers to improve the robustness, ease of use, and design of this software.
